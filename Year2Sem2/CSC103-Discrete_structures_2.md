# Modular Arithmetic
## Divisibility
**$a$** is divisible by $b$ denoted by $b \mid a$ if there's an integer $k$ such that $$a = b \times k$$
The intuitive sense of this definition is simple (for positive a & b):
- Say we have an object
- We'd like to split 'em into groups of size $b$
- This is possible if $a$ is divisible by $b$
- $k$ is the resulting number of groups
E.g.,: $3\mid \frac{12}{= 4}$
## Division with remainders
Suppose $b$ is a positive integer. The result of the division of $a$ by $b$ is a pair of integers, $q$ called quotient & $r$ called remainder such that $$a = q \times b + r$$ and $0 \leq r \leq b$
E.g.,:
- $a = 15, b = 4$. Then $15 = 3 \times 4 + 3$ & $q=3,r=3$

## Modular Arithmetic?
- System of arithmetic for integers
- Wrap around after reaching a certain value called **_modulus_**
- Central mathematical concept in cryptography
- ~~also used in reading clock~~
## Congruence
- In cryptography, congruence ($\equiv$) instead of equality ($=$)
E.g.,
- $15 \equiv 3 \text{ mod }12$
- $23 \equiv 11 \text{ mod } 12$
- $33 \equiv 3 \text{ mod } 10$
- $10 \equiv -2 \text{ mod } 12$

## Congruence Relations
We say that two numbers $a$ and $b$ are **_congruent modulo_** $m$ if they have the same remainder when divided by $m$. We write $$a \equiv b \text{ mod } m$$
## Properties of Modular Arithmetic
1. \[(a mod n) + (b mod n)] mod n = (a + b) mod n
2. \[(a mod n) - (b mod n)] mod n = (a - b) mod m
3. \[(a mod n) \* (b mod n)] mod n = (a * b) mod n
### Laws & Identities
0. Format: Property
	- Expression
1. Commutative Laws
	- (a + b) mod n = (b + a) mod n
	- (a \* b) mod n = (b * a) mod n
2. Associative Laws
	- \[(a + b) + c] mod n = \[a + (b + c)] mod n
	- \[(a * b) * c] mod n = \[a * (b * c)] mod n
3. Distributive Laws
	- \[a * (b + c)] mod n = \[(a * b) + (a * c)] mod n
4. Identities
	- (0 + a) mod n = a mod n
	- (1 * a) mod n = a mod n
5. Additive Inverse
	- For each $a \in Z_n$, there exist a '$-a$' such that $a + (-a) \equiv 0$ mod n
# Congruence Relations & Modular Exponentiation
## Congruence Relation
If $a$ and $b$ are integers and $m$ is a positive integer, them $a$ is ***congruent*** to $b$ if m iff $m \mid (a-b)$
- The notation $a\equiv b$(mod $m$) says that $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$
- We say that $a \equiv b$(mod $m$) is a congruence and that $m$ is its modulus
- Two integers are congruent mod $m$ if and only if they have the same remainder when divided by $m$
- If $a$ isn't congruent to $b$ modulo $m$, we write $a \not\equiv b$(mod $m$)
## Modular Exponentiation
- a type of exponentiation performed over a modulus
- i.e., $a^b$ mod $m$ or $a^b$ (mod $m$)
$\def\mod{\text{ mod }}$
E.g.,
- $2^{33} \mod 30$
- $3^{100} \mod 29$
- $31^{500} \mod 30$

- $23^{16} \mod 30$
$$\begin{align}
= (((23^2)^2)^2)^2 \mod 30 \\
= (((-7^2)^2)^2)^2 \mod 30 \\
= ((49^2)^2)^2 \mod 30 \\
=((19^2)^2)^2 \mod 30 \\
= ((-11^2)^2)^2 \mod 30 \\
= 1 \mod 30 \\
= 1👍

\end{align}$$

# GCD And Euclidian Algorithm
## Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
Let $a,b \in Z - {0}$. The largest integer $d$ such that $d\mid a$ and also $d \mid b$ is called the **greatest common divisor** of $a$ & $b$. It's denoted by gcd(a,b).
E.g., gcd(24,36) = 12

The integers $a$ & $b$ are **relatively coprime** if and only if gcd(a,b) = 1.
E.g.,: 17, 22 (22 != Prime btw)

The integers $a_1, a_2,…a_n$ are **pairwise relatively prime** if and only if gcd($a_i,a_j$) whenever $1 \leq i \lt j \leq n$

E.g.,: 10, 17, & 21 are pairwise relatively prime, since gcd(10,17) = gcd(10,21) = gcd(17, 21) = 1.

##  Euclidian Algorithm

> [!NOTE] Lemma
> Let $a=bq+r$, where $a,b,q,$ and $r$  are integers.
> Then gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r).

> [!NOTE] Proof
> Suppose that $d$ divides both $a$ & $b$. Then $d$ also divides $a-bq=r$.
> Hence, any common divisor of $a$ & $b$ must be also be a common divisor of $b$ & $r$.
> For the opposite direction suppose that $d$ divides both $b$ & $r$. Then $d$ also divides $bq+r=a$. Hence, any common divisor of $b$ & $r$ must be a common divisor of $a$ & $b$.
> $\therefore gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r)$

This means that if $a \gt b$, then gcd(a,b), gcd(a,b, mod b), which directly yields the algorithm. (Note that both args have gotten smaller. One can show that its complexity is $O(\log b)$
**To compute gcd(a,b):**
1. Divide $a$ by $b$, get remainder $r$
2. Replace $a$ with $b$, $b$ with $r$
3. Repeat until $r=0$. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD

E.g.,
1. gcd(252,105)
	1. 252 % 105 = 42
	2. 105 % 42 = 21
	3. 42 % 21 = 0
	4. $\therefore gcd(252,105)=21$
# Co-Prime, Phi Function & Multiplicative Inverse 
## Totient Function
- denoted as $\phi(n)$
- $\phi (n)$ = number of positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$
E.g.,
- $\phi(31)=30$ since 31 is prime
##  Multiplicative Inverse

> [!NOTE] Definition
> 
>
>An integer $\bar{a}$ such that $\bar{a}a \equiv 1 (\mod m)$ is called a **multiplicative inverse** of $a (\mod m)$

Multiplicative inverses can be used to solve congruences. If $ax \equiv b (\mod m)$, then $\bar{a}ax \equiv (\bar{a}b)(\mod m)$, thus $x \equiv (\bar{a}b)(\mod m)$.
