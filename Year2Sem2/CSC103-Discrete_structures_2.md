# Modular Arithmetic
## Divisibility
**$a$** is divisible by $b$ denoted by $b | a$ if there's an integer $k$ such that $$a = b \times k$$
The intuitive sense of this definition is simple (for positive a & b):
- Say we have an object
- We'd like to split 'em into groups of size $b$
- This is possible if $a$ is divisible by $b$
- $k$ is the resulting number of groups
E.g.,: $3\mid \frac{12}{= 4}$
## Division with remainders
Suppose $b$ is a positive integer. The result of the division of $a$ by $b$ is a pair of integers, $q$ called quotient & $r$ called remainder such that $$a = q \times b + r$$ and $0 \leq r \leq b$
